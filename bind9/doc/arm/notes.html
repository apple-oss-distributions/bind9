<a name="root_key"></a>New DNSSEC Root Key</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      ICANN is in the process of introducing a new Key Signing Key (KSK) for
      the global root zone. BIND has multiple methods for managing DNSSEC
      trust anchors, with somewhat different behaviors. If the root
      key is configured using the <span class="command"><strong>managed-keys</strong></span>
      statement, or if the pre-configured root key is enabled by using
      <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-validation auto</strong></span>, then BIND can keep keys up
      to date automatically. Servers configured in this way should have
      begun the process of rolling to the new key when it was published in
      the root zone in July 2017. However, keys configured using the
      <span class="command"><strong>trusted-keys</strong></span> statement are not automatically
      maintained. If your server is performing DNSSEC validation and is
      configured using <span class="command"><strong>trusted-keys</strong></span>, you are advised to
      change your configuration before the root zone begins signing with
      the new KSK. This is currently scheduled for October 11, 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      This release includes an updated version of the
      <code class="filename">bind.keys</code> file containing the new root
      key. This file can also be downloaded from
      <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/bind-keys" target="_top">
